"""Gate logic: compare candidate vs baseline under the registry -> PROMOTE/BLOCK.

Pure functions so tests/test_l0_gate.py can verify every branch. Rules:
  - hard metric breaching its threshold                  -> BLOCK
  - hard metric regressing beyond noise band vs baseline -> BLOCK
  - soft metric breach/regression                        -> WARN (human review)
  - monitor_only                                         -> report only
  - NaN / non-finite / non-numeric score                 -> BLOCK, always (IE-07)
Band used = max(registry noise_band, measured 2σ from baseline).

Fail-closed rationale (IE-07, FM-02/FM-05): NaN compares False against every
threshold, so before this rule a NaN score sailed through both the breach and
the regression checks and PASSed silently. A score that isn't a finite number
is not a measurement; it blocks regardless of the metric's blocking tier —
same policy as a metric missing from the candidate run.
